          Earthing is a way of transmitting any instant electricity discharge/
          lightning directly to the ground through low resistance wires,
          electrical cables or conductive materials. Earthing provides
          protection from lightning & voltage surges for personal protection,
          property protection, etc.. The earthing component is connected between
          the equipment body or enclosure and the earth pit which is placed
          under the earth surface. The solar modules, inverter and aluminum
          frames of a PV system should be grounded for protection from
          lightning. The components required for earthing of a PV system are:

              Earth plate is hidden underground and linked to the earthing
              joint. It can be a pipe, plate or metallic rod, or plate made of
              copper or iron rod and must be placed in wet earth. In the case
              where the moisture is of low content, then some water is to be

              This is the most common type of earthing system where a galvanized
              steel based pipe is placed vertically in a wet pit. The pipe size
              mainly depends on the soil type and magnitude of current. For
              rocky or dry soil, the pipe diameter should be greater than the
              ordinary soil pipe. The soil moisture will decide the pipeâ€™s
              length to be placed in the earth.
