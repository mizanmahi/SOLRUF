        fuel to renewable energy policies has increased the demand for solar
        products trade and clean power generation. We aim to amplify and
        facilitate this process.We believe that encouraging simplified
        communication between buyer/seller along with widespread visibility for
        vendor offerings is the foundation for increasing solar adoption and
        promoting free trade in India.
